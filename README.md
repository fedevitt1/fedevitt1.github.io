# Federico Vittori Counter

Apllication that works as a counter.

## Description

I created a simple application with a counter in the main screen. 
The count starts from 0 and the user has two +/- buttons to increase or decrease the counter at will, at any time it wants.
I decided to use monochromatic colors on the tenolity of orange.
